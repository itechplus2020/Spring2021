The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.

It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output/dependent variable called "Class". Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values. The variable names are as follows:

1. Number of times pregnant.(NbrPrg)
2. Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test.(PlasmGluc)
3. Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).(DiaBLoodPressure)
4. Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).(TricSkThick)
5. 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).(SerumInsuline)
6. Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).(BodyMass)
7. Diabetes pedigree function.(DiabetePedFunc)
8. Age (years). (Age)
9. Class variable (0 or 1).(Class)

The baseline performance of predicting the most prevalent class is a classification accuracy of approximately 65%. Top results achieve a classification accuracy of approximately 77%.
