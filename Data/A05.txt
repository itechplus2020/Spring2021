Grape Juice Dataset

The Grape Juice Quality Dataset involves predicting the quality of white Grape Juice on a scale given chemical measures of each wine.

It is a multi-class classification problem, but could also be framed as a regression problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 4,898 observations with 11 input variables and one dependent/output variable (Quality). The variable names are as follows:

1. Fixed acidity.
2. Volatile acidity.
3. Citric acid.
4. Residual sugar.
5. Chlorides.
6. Free sulfur dioxide.
7. Total sulfur dioxide.
8. Density.
9. pH.
10 Sulphates.
11. Alcohol.
12. Quality (score between 0 and 10).

The baseline performance of predicting the mean value is an RMSE of approximately 0.148 quality points.
