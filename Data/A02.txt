Breast Tissue Dataset

Dataset with electrical impedance measurements in samples of freshly excised tissue from the breast						
						
106 instances						
10 attributes: 9 features/attributes + 1 "Class" attribute (dependent) +1 Case# wich is not used for analysis.												
The aim is to analyse the 9 attributes to find out one of the six classes of freshly excised tissue, which were studied using electrical impedance measurements:						
				# of cases		
	Car	Carcinoma		21		
	Fad	Fibro-adenoma		15		
	Mas	Mastopathy		18		
	Gla	Glandular		16		
	Con	Connective		14		
	Adi	Adipose		22		
				106		
Impedance measurements were made at the frequencies: 15.625, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1000 KHz. These measurements plotted in the (real, -imaginary) plane constitute 						
The impedance spectrum from where the features below are computed.				
		
9 features/attributes:						
						
	I0	Impedivity (ohm) at zero frequency				
	PA500	phase angle at 500 KHz				
	HFS	high-frequency slope of phase angle				
	DA	impedance distance between spectral ends				
	AREA	area under spectrum				
	A/DA	area normalized by DA				
	MAX IP	maximum of the spectrum				
	DR	distance between I0 and real part of the maximum frequency point			P	length of the spectral curve
