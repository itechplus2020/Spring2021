Grains Data Set Information:
The aim of analyzing this dataset is to find out the grain’s variety (dependent/output) attribute given the six features/attributes like area of the grain, perimeter of the grain, kernel length, kernel width, etc.  The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties of grains (grainsVariety): 1, 2 and 3 with 201 elements each, randomly selected for the experiment.
 High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Lublin. 

The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.
Attribute Information:
To construct the data, six geometric parameters below of Grains kernels were measured to find out the grains variety (grainsVariety): 
1. area A, 
2. perimeter P, 
3. kernelLength 
4. kernelWidth, 
5. asymCoef 
6. GrooveLength. 

All of these parameters were real-valued continuous.
